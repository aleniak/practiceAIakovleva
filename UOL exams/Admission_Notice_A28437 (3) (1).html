<p><center><b>Notice to Candidates</b></center></p>
<p><center><b>Online Timed Assessment - 2022</b></center></p>



 
<p>Your online timed assessments in 2022 will be delivered via the Inspera Exam Portal. The past papers available on your programme Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) continue to be a good revision resource, whether you are being assessed for the first time this year or have sat previously.</p>

<p>Depending on your programme, there may be some minor differences to ensure that assessment remains fair, valid and reliable under these alternative conditions. That may mean, for example, changes to the number of questions you will be asked to answer, the way those questions are asked or the amount of time you have to answer them. There will also be arrangements in place to detect and respond to instances where candidates break the rules for assessment.</p>

<p>We have developed a <a href="https://d28lyjfgvs18xy.cloudfront.net/exam_support/prepare-for-your-online-assessments/content/index.html#/l" target="_blank"><u>short online course</u></a> to help you prepare for your assessments.</p>

<p><b>In addition to this general notice and the rules for online timed assessment, you should carefully read the additional programme guidance below, follow any paper-specific instructions issued to you and consult the <a href="https://london.ac.uk/current-students/programme-documents/regulations" target="_blank"><u>General Regulations</u></a> on Online Timed Assessment.</b></p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Accessing your assessment</u></p>

<p>• Your Admission Notice contains your candidate number and lists the assessments that you are registered for.</p>

<p>• The dates on which your assessments will become available will be quoted on page one of this notice. If you are required to start your assessments at a particular time, this will also be quoted.</p>

<p>• Take advantage of any practice sessions offered by your programme to go through the log-on, system check and ID check process, and make sure you are able to access the Inspera Exam Portal now. It may take us several days to resolve any issues you might have. If you have any access issues, please log a query under 'Ask a question’ on your <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk" target="_blank"><u>portal homepage</u></a> as soon as possible using the 'Online Assessment’ category.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Completing your assessment</u></p>

<p>• From the time the assessment is released, you will have a set amount of time to submit your completed answers. This time-period is stated in the programme-specific information at the end of this notice and will also be confirmed when you access your assessment.</p>

<p>• You are asked to complete the assessment within the specified time given in the assessment question paper and use any remaining time to submit your answer.</p>

<p>• You do not need to remain online as you write your answers unless this is specified in your assessment instructions.</p>

<p>• Work submitted for assessment must be entirely your own.</p>

<p>• For assessments with a word limit, this is a maximum and not the amount you should write.</p>

<p>• Do not upload rough work unless your assessment instructions tell you to.</p>

<p>• You must follow the rules for online timed assessment listed below (Rules for Online Timed Assessments). Please read these carefully. Breaking any of these rules may result in an allegation of assessment offence.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Submitting your assessment</u></p>

<p>• Do not include your name anywhere in your answers. Your candidate number will be used to identify you during the marking process.</p>

<p>• If your paper requires you to handwrite certain sections (for example, to complete diagrams or mathematical formulae) you will need to photograph these with your mobile device/scanner and submit your work as files in the format specified in the programme-specific information towards the end of this notice.	</p>

<p>• If you have a special examination arrangement in place that allows you to submit a completely handwritten script you will need to photograph your work with a mobile device/scanner and submit it in the same way through the Inspera Exam Portal.</p>

<p>• For papers that require submission of a file (e.g. a scanned PDF of a handwritten answer), you must submit your answers by the deadlines we have set and in line with our <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk/documents/10197/80507983/Online+Submission+Policy.pdf/87c44bb9-d062-6268-628f-27268067ba64?t=1617007452742" target="_blank"><u>Online Submission Policy</u></a>. Failure to submit your answers by the deadlines may result in a penalty or your work not being accepted.</p>

<p>• Follow the on-screen instructions for submitting your work and closing the Inspera Exam Portal to ensure that your work and proctoring data is uploaded correctly and completely. </p>

<p>• For papers that require you to handwrite your answers and upload a scanned PDF or for papers that require submission of a Word file, if we cannot open the files you have submitted or there appear to be no files, we will treat your submission as a valid attempt, and you will receive a mark of zero for the work concerned.</p>

<p>• If your file is blank we will treat your submission as a valid attempt and you will receive a mark of zero for the work concerned.</p>

<p>• We will mark the work you have submitted as it is. We will not permit you to submit a further version of your work after the deadline.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Mitigating circumstances, illness and other problems</u></p>

<p>• Mitigating circumstances are problems beyond your control, which generally occur without warning, and which may have negatively affected your performance in an assessment. If you are unwell or encounter problems which you believe have affected your performance, you should submit a query using the 'ask a question button’ on your <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk" target="_blank"><u>portal homepage</u></a>.</p>

<p>• You must write within <b>three weeks</b> of the date of your last online timed assessment including, where possible, a detailed medical report made at the time of the illness and/or other relevant evidence. Submissions received more than three weeks after your last assessment will not be considered.</p>

<p>• If the regulations for your programme state that by sitting an examination you are declaring yourself fit to do so, this will also apply to your online timed assessment. You should check your <a href="https://london.ac.uk/current-students/programme-documents/regulations" target="_blank"><u>Programme Regulations</u></a> carefully before you take the assessment.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Inclusive practice and access arrangements</u></p>

<p>• If you already had access arrangements approved for the examinations, they may not all necessarily be applicable for the online examinations as the online format differs from the exam centre hand-written format.</p>

<p>• If you have a disability or medical condition and/or new access requirements resulting from the move to online timed assessments, please contact us as soon as possible and at least two weeks before your first assessment date. A panel will consider your request in line with the University’s 'Inclusive Practice Policy'.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Marking process and publication of results</u></p>

<p>• The standard practice for confirmation of results and awards by the Board of Examiners will be in place for all online timed assessments.</p>

<p>• Assessment scripts will either be marked independently by two examiners, or moderated by a team of examiners, and confirmed by the Board of Examiners. There is no procedure to consider appeals against assessment results on academic grounds.</p>

<p>• You can apply for your results to be re-checked if you think there has been an administrative error. Details of this service will be available through the student portal when your results are released.</p>

<p>• Keep your Admission Notice safe as you will need your candidate number to access your results.<p>

<p><b>More detailed instructions, for example regarding technical aspects of the online timed assessment process, will be provided in advance of, or at the time of, your online assessment.</b></p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Rules for Online Timed Assessments</u></p>

<p><b>All assessments of the University of London are taken in accordance with the General Regulations, which exists to keep assessments fair and ensure academic integrity, by preventing students from gaining an unfair advantage over others. Plagiarism, collusion, contract cheating and sharing information about assessments are considered unfair advantages in all assessments, including those taken on the Inspera platform.</b></p>

<p><b>The rules below tell you what you must and must not do during assessments taken on the Inpsera platform. The use of text-matching software (Turnitin) and data gathered through your webcam, your microphone and from the recording of your screen, may be used in the detection and investigation of potential assessment offences.	
You should be aware that if you break any of the following rules, your case may be considered under the <u><a href="https://my.london.ac.uk/group/student/assessment-offence-procedures" target="_blank">Assessment Offence Procedures</a></u>.</b></p>

<p><b>Important: These rules must be read alongside the additional programme-level guidance below. Your programme may modify or supplement individual rules for Online Timed Assessment for some or all assessments.</b></p>
  
<p>1. You must follow the <a href="https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/general-regulations-2021-2022.pdf" target="_blank">General Regulations</a> and all instructions given to you by the University in advance, and at the time of, your assessment.</p>

<p>2. You cannot take an assessment if you have not received an Admission Notice from us.</p>

<p>3. You must present valid and original photographic identification (driving licence, passport, national ID) as part of the set-up process at the beginning of each assessment.  	</p>

<p>4. You must comply with all conditions imposed on you by the Inspera Exam Portal. You are not permitted to copy and paste text into the platform. You are not permitted to access any other application on your device when the lockdown browser is enabled.  	</p>

<p>5.You should undertake your assessment in a room on your own, unless guided otherwise. You should also ensure that the background behind you is plain and does not contain posters, photographs or paintings. The presence of others will be flagged by the system and delays to your results may occur as these flags are checked and cleared. Depending on the nature of the presence of others, this may also be considered an assessment offence.	</p>

<p>6. You must not talk to others whilst taking your assessment. You should also avoid unnecessary noise, such as talking to yourself, or being near others who are talking. Noise in the room you are taking assessments will be flagged by the system and delays to your results may occur as these flags are checked and cleared. Depending on the nature of such discussions, these may also be considered an assessment offence.	</p>

<p>7. The use of earphones, earbuds or any other type of listening device is not permitted during your assessment unless you have been given special permission to do so (e.g. as part of a specific access request).	</p>

<p>8. The use of smartwatches, or other such devices, is not permitted during your assessment.	</p>

<p>9. You must keep to the rules set by your Programme regarding the use of additional materials, books, papers or instruments during your assessment.	</p>

<p>10. All work you submit for assessment must be your own, expressed in your own words and include your own ideas and judgements. By submitting work for assessment, you confirm that the work is entirely your own and has been completed on your own, without the assistance of others.	</p>

<p>11. Submitting work which has been written by someone else at your request, either in full or in part, is contract cheating, which is prohibited. This remains the case whether you have made payment for this service or not.	</p>

<p>12. Unless guided otherwise, if you make direct use of somebody else’s work, either by memorising it or copying it word-for-word from a source, these passages should be included within double quotation marks, with no spaces between the text and quotation marks. You should also include the details of where you have copied or memorised the material from in the following format (Author, Date).</p>
<p>e.g., "Sample Text" (University of London, 2022)</p>

<p>13. Unless guided otherwise, you should not submit work, in whole or part, which you have previously submitted for assessment or publication.	</p>

<p>14. During the time an assessment is live you must not request or exchange information, or engage in any discussion, about the assessment in such a way that yourself or another student taking, or yet to take, the paper may be advantaged. This includes, but is not limited to, using live assistance services on the internet, engaging in online discussions, verbal exchanges, video conferencing, screen-sharing, copying or allowing your work to be copied or posting any contents of the assessment or your answer online.</p>

<p>15. You must not submit work which has been written jointly by two or more people. If two or more students submit the same or similar pieces of work, all answer scripts will be referred for investigation and subject to penalties, if an offence is proven.	</p>

<p>16. Where handwriting is permitted, or required, for your assessment your answers must be legible. You should write as clearly as possible. Only use dark ink (blue or black) on lightly coloured paper. If a submission is considered to be illegible by the Examiners, you may be awarded a mark of zero for that assessment, or part of the assessment. No answers will be transcribed.	</p>

<p>17. You must type, or handwrite (where permitted), all of your answers in English, unless you are instructed otherwise.	</p>

<p>18. Do not include your name anywhere in the file you submit, including the title.	</p>

<p>19. You must adhere to the word count where one is given. Submitting work in excess of the total may result in work after that point not being marked, or the application of a penalty.	</p>

<p>20. You must submit your answers by the deadlines we have set and according to the Online Submission Policy. Failure to submit your answers by the deadlines, or according to the Online Submission Policy, may result in the application of a penalty or your work not being accepted.	</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Further advice</u></p>

<p>• You are advised to thoroughly read the instructions provided to you when your assessment is released before you start writing.</p>

<p>• When you have completed your assessment, make sure you submit any additional components (e.g. rough work, notes, plans, calculations) if the question paper instructions require you to.</p>

<p>• All suspected assessment offences will be referred by the Board of Examiners and considered in line with the <i>Procedures for the Consideration of Allegations of Assessment Offence</i>.</p>

<p>• If you are the subject of an allegation, you will be contacted under the Procedures and asked to provide a statement. Your results will be withheld whilst investigations are ongoing.</p>

<p>• Proven offences are likely to result in a formal reprimand, the equivalent of a zero mark and the loss of a permitted attempt. Offences in future sessions are subject to escalated penalties, which include the equivalent of a zero mark for the full module or year.</p>

<p><i>University of London assessments are governed by the University's Regulations and Ordinances, Guidelines for Examinations, the Programme & General Regulations and this Notice.</i></p>

</p>

<p>
<b><u>Before the Day of the Assessment</u></b>
</p>

<p>
You must download the IEP to your device before the assessment begins. Once downloaded, open and run the system checks to make sure there are no problems with your device running the IEP software. We recommend you do this at least 72-hours before your first online timed assessment to give you time to address any problems which occur.
</p>

<p>
Log on to the IEP using your usual portal username and password. Although you will not be able to start the online timed assessment before the start time for the assessment you will see your online timed assessments listed. Your assessments will be displayed at least 72 hours before they are due to start.
</p>

<p>
Make a note of the PIN code to unlock the assessment. The PIN code will be the same as the course code of the online timed assessment you are taking:
</p>

<p>
For example, the PIN code for AC1025 Principles of Accounting will be <b>ac1025</b> (all lowercase).
</p>

<p>
Ensure you have an original photographic ID to hand for the start of the assessment (e.g a photo Driving Licence; passport; or any government or local authority issued photo ID)
</p>

<p>
A practice exam has been held but please look out for email invitations to further practice opportunities.

</p>

<p>
<b><u>On the Day of the Assessment</u></b>
</p>

<p>
Log in to the Inspera Exam Portal (IEP) at the time specified for your allocated zone:<br>
Zone A. The start time will be 16:00 BST.<br>
Zone B. The start time will be 09:00 BST.<br>
</p>

<p>
The assessment will be made live at the start time for your relevant zone. 
</p>

<p>
Complete the system checks, the webcam, screen recording, disk space, ID and microphone checks. When you are ready to start the assessment, click on the ‘start’ button. Your assessment, including the screen, webcam and voice recording, will start at this point but you will have however long is remaining of the time allowed for the assessment to type, write and submit your answers.
</p>

<p>
For purely qualitative exams that require typed answers, the questions will display directly on the Inspera platform. For quantitative exams or exams that have a mix of quantitative and qualitative questions the questions will display as a PDF.
</p>

<p>
Please remember, if you access the questions, you will be deemed to have made an attempt at the assessment for the module concerned. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Work on your answers</b>
</p>

<p>
Full information on how you should submit your answers will be available on the Assessment instructions. 
</p>

<p>
For purely qualitative exams you will type all your answers directly into the IEP. 
</p>

<p>
For quantitative exams you will handwrite your answers in black ink on light coloured paper, then scan and upload these as a single PDF on to the Inspera platform.  
</p>

<p>
For exams that are a mix of qualitative and quantitative questions, you will type your answers in to Word processing software, copy in any handwritten work, and upload it as a single document on to the IEP. These should be a .doc or .docx file. If you do not have access to Microsoft Word, other word processing apps, including free online versions (Google Docs, Open Office, etc.) allow you to save or export as a Word file. Please <b>do not</b> use any other document format.   
</p>

<p>
<b>Save and submit your answers by the deadline</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Submitting your work</b>
</p>

<p>
You can submit your work at any point before the assessment ends if you have finished the assessment. When the end time has been reached you will automatically be taken to the submit page of the IEP. Upload any documents, where this is a requirement of your assessment, and click on ‘Submit’ and then wait for IEP to upload all your answers and proctoring data. <b>Do not</b> close the application. It will close automatically after all the data has been uploaded. <b>If you close the application before it finishes, your data may be lost and your attempt may not count.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>“Scanning” your work</b>
</p>

<p>  
For handwritten papers, it is important to note that examiners will not mark work that is illegible. For best results, you should use a scanning app such as Microsoft Office Lens (or MS Lens) or Adobe Scan to create a pdf version of your work. Several scanning apps are available free of charge and will enable you to produce high quality images quickly and easily using your laptop, tablet or smartphone. Although we recommend that use of an app such as MS Lens or Adobe Scan, you can also photograph your work and upload it through your mobile device.
</p>

<p>
Try to find an uncluttered and well-lit space to make your files most legible.
</p>

<p>
Allow for enough time to do this without missing your assessment submission deadlines (your previous practice should give you an indication of how much time you need).
</p>

<p>
If you encounter a problem during the assessment or when submitting your assessment please log a query under ‘Ask a question’ on your <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk" target="_blank">portal homepage</a> as soon as possible. Please use the Online Assessment Submission category and the dedicated live module sub-category, for example EMFSS Live – Introduction to Economics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Review your scan and check that pages are:</b><br>
Scanned in the correct order.<br>
Oriented properly.<br>
Legible (e.g. scans are not blurry and all fine detail can be sufficiently magnified for reading).<br>
Complete (e.g. relevant work has not been accidentally cropped out).
</p>

<p>Do not use any Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality offered by your scanning application when producing your scans. OCR may be turned on by default, so you may need to disable it through the application’s settings.</p>
